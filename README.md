   4. Considerations
      All data will be encrypted on the Database.
      I could not make all Unit test required, i created all I have time.
      I would like to implement Data sanitization (I validated the data with a minimum requirements) and enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) but I have not time for.
